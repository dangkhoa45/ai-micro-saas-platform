# Phase 2 - AI Core Module Implementation Summary

## ✅ Status: COMPLETED

All Phase 2 tasks have been successfully implemented and documented.

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. **Generic AI API Endpoint** (`/api/ai/generate`)

- Full-featured text generation API
- Zod validation for all inputs
- Authentication and quota enforcement
- Comprehensive error handling
- Response time tracking

### 2. **Rate Limiting System**

- Plan-based limits (5-120 requests/minute)
- In-memory store with automatic cleanup
- HTTP rate limit headers
- Integration with logging

### 3. **Structured Logging**

- JSON logging for production
- Specialized loggers (AI, API, auth, etc.)
- Performance measurement utilities
- Context-based tracking

### 4. **Usage Tracking System**

- Centralized utilities in `/packages/lib/usage.ts`
- Functions: logUsage, getUserUsageStats, getDailyUsage, etc.
- Comprehensive analytics queries
- Cost and token tracking

### 5. **Usage Dashboard** (`/dashboard/usage`)

- Overview statistics cards
- Usage by model/app visualization
- Daily usage charts
- Recent activity log
- Quota warnings and alerts

### 6. **Comprehensive Test Suite**

- 24+ test cases
- Mock mode support
- Integration tests
- Error scenario coverage

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Set Up Environment

Ensure you have these variables in `.env`:

```env
# Required
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# Optional (for mock mode)
AI_MOCK=1
```

### 2. Run the Test Suite

```bash
# Mock mode (no API calls, free)
AI_MOCK=1 npm run test:ai

# Real API tests (requires API keys, costs money)
npm run test:ai
```

### 3. Test the API Endpoint

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test the endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Say hello",
    "maxTokens": 50
  }'
```

**Note:** You'll need to be authenticated. Use the app UI to sign in first.

### 4. View the Usage Dashboard

1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/usage`
3. View your usage statistics, costs, and analytics

### 5. Test Rate Limiting

```bash
# Send multiple rapid requests to trigger rate limit
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/generate \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"prompt":"Test"}' &
done
```

You should see 429 errors after exceeding your plan's limit.
